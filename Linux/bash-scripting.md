## 1\. Basic Structure & Shebang

Every Bash script should begin with a **shebang** line. This line tells your system which interpreter to use for running the script.

  * **Shebang:** `#!/bin/bash`

      * It must be the **very first line** of your script.
      * A more portable alternative is `#!/usr/bin/env bash`. This tells the system to use the `bash` executable found in the user's `PATH`, which can be more robust if `bash` isn't always in `/bin`.

  * **Execution:**

    1.  **Make it executable:** Before running, you need to grant execute permissions.
        ```bash
        chmod +x your_script_name.sh
        ```
    2.  **Run the script:**
        ```bash
        ./your_script_name.sh
        ```

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This is a very simple Bash script.
echo "Hello, Bash World!"
```

-----

## 2\. Comments

Comments are essential for explaining your script's logic. Bash ignores anything marked as a comment, so they don't affect script execution.

  * **Single-line comments:** Start with a **pound sign (`#`)**.
  * **Multi-line comments (workaround):** Bash doesn't have a direct multi-line comment syntax like some other languages. A common workaround uses a "here document" directed to a no-op command (`:`).

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This is a single-line comment, explaining the next command.
echo "This line will be executed."

: '
This is a multi-line comment.
You can write several lines of explanation here.
Bash treats this block as input to the null command (`:`), effectively ignoring it.
'
echo "This line runs after the multi-line comment."
```

## 3\. Variables

Variables are used to store data within your script. In Bash, all variables are essentially **strings**, though Bash can perform arithmetic on them if they contain numbers.

### User-Defined Variables

  * **Declaration & Assignment:** `VARIABLE_NAME="value"`
      * **Crucially:** There should be **no spaces** around the equals sign (`=`).
      * Variable names are typically uppercase by convention, but can be lowercase.
      * Enclosing values in double quotes (`"`) is good practice, especially if the value contains spaces or special characters.
  * **Accessing:** Use a dollar sign (`$`) before the variable name: `$VARIABLE_NAME`.
      * It's safer and clearer to use curly braces: `${VARIABLE_NAME}`. This helps avoid ambiguity when concatenating variables with other text (e.g., `${VAR}suffix` instead of `$VARsuffix`).
  * **Read-only Variables:** `readonly VARIABLE_NAME`
      * Once declared `readonly`, a variable's value cannot be changed or `unset`.
  * **Unsetting Variables:** `unset VARIABLE_NAME`
      * Removes the variable completely from the shell's memory.
  * **Local Variables (in functions):** `local VARIABLE_NAME="value"`
      * Used inside functions to ensure the variable exists only within that function's scope, preventing interference with global variables of the same name.

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
MY_NAME="Alice"
AGE=30 # Even though it's a number, Bash treats it as a string
echo "Hello, my name is $MY_NAME and I am $AGE years old."

# Using curly braces for clarity
MY_FILE_PREFIX="report"
echo "The full filename is: ${MY_FILE_PREFIX}_2024.txt"

readonly PI_VALUE=3.14159
echo "Pi is: $PI_VALUE"
# PI_VALUE=3.14 # This would cause an error: `PI_VALUE: readonly variable`

unset MY_NAME # Remove MY_NAME
# echo "My name is now: $MY_NAME" # This would output an empty line (or error with `set -u`)
```

### Special Variables

Bash provides a set of **predefined variables** that hold useful information about the script's execution, arguments, and status.

| Variable | Description | Example Output/Usage |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------- |
| `$0` | The **name of the script** or command being executed. | If you run `./my_script.sh`, `$0` is `./my_script.sh`. |
| `$1`, `$2`, ... | **Positional parameters** â€“ arguments passed to the script. `$1` is the first argument, `$2` is the second, and so on. | If you run `./script.sh arg1 arg2`, then `$1` is `arg1`, `$2` is `arg2`. |
| `$#` | The **number of positional parameters** (arguments) passed to the script. | If you run `./script.sh a b c`, `$#` is `3`. |
| `$*` | All positional parameters as a **single string**. When double-quoted (`"$*"`), it expands to `"arg1 arg2 arg3"`. | If you run `./script.sh a b c`, `echo "$*"` outputs `a b c`. |
| `$@` | All positional parameters as **separate strings**. When double-quoted (`"$@"`), it expands to `"$1" "$2" "$3"`, which is generally preferred for loops or when passing arguments. | If you run `./script.sh a b c`, `for arg in "$@"; do echo "$arg"; done` will iterate over `"a"`, then `"b"`, then `"c"`. |
| `$?` | The **exit status** of the last executed command or function. `0` indicates success; any non-zero value indicates an error. | After `ls /path/to/existing_file.txt`, `echo $?` outputs `0`. After `ls /path/to/nonexistent_file.txt`, `echo $?` outputs `1` or `2`. |
| `$$` | The **Process ID (PID)** of the current shell (the script's own PID). | `echo $$` might output `12345`. |
| `$!` | The **PID of the last command run in the background**. | After `sleep 10 &`, `echo $!` prints the PID of the `sleep` command. |
| `$-` | The **current options** set for the shell. | `echo $-` might output `himBH`. These are shell options (e.g., `h` for hashing, `i` for interactive shell, `m` for monitor mode). |
| `$_` | The **last argument** of the previous command. | `mkdir my_dir; cd $_` will change directory to `my_dir`. |

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Script name: $0"
echo "First argument: $1"
echo "Second argument: $2"
echo "Number of arguments: $#"
echo "All arguments as one string: '$*'"
echo "All arguments as separate strings (best for loops):"
for arg in "$@"; do
    echo "- $arg"
done

# Demonstrate exit status
ls /non_existent_file_123.txt
echo "Exit status of last command (ls): $?"

# Demonstrate PID
echo "Current script's PID: $$"
```

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are variables that are **available to all processes** running within a particular shell session, including child processes (like your script) that are spawned from that shell.

  * **Viewing:**
      * `env`: Lists all environment variables.
      * `printenv`: Similar to `env`, often used to print a specific variable if given an argument.
      * `declare -x`: Shows all exported variables.
  * **Setting & Exporting:** `export MY_VAR="value"`
      * Using `export` makes a variable an environment variable, accessible by child processes. Without `export`, it's just a shell variable (local to the current shell/script).
  * **Accessing:** Just like user-defined variables, use `$MY_VAR`.

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Current user: $USER"      # Common environment variable
echo "Home directory: $HOME"    # Common environment variable
echo "PATH: $PATH"              # Common environment variable (directories where commands are searched)

# Define and export a custom environment variable
export MY_CUSTOM_MESSAGE="This message is in the environment!"

# Run a subshell and check if the variable is accessible
bash -c 'echo "Inside subshell: $MY_CUSTOM_MESSAGE"'

# This variable is NOT exported, so it won't be in the subshell's environment
LOCAL_MESSAGE="This message is local to the current script."
bash -c 'echo "Inside subshell (local var): $LOCAL_MESSAGE"' # Will be empty
```

## 4\. Input/Output (I/O)

Managing how your script interacts with the user and files is fundamental.

### `echo`

The simplest command for printing text to **standard output (stdout)**.

  * `echo "text"`: Prints the given text followed by a newline.
  * `echo -e "Text with\nnewlines"`: The `-e` option enables the interpretation of backslash escapes (like `\n` for newline, `\t` for tab).
  * `echo -n "No trailing newline"`: The `-n` option suppresses the default trailing newline character.

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, world!" # Basic echo

echo -e "Line 1\n\tLine 2 (tabbed)" # With escape sequences

echo -n "This is one line. " # No newline
echo "This continues it." # Continues on the same line
```

### `printf`

A more powerful and flexible command for formatted printing, similar to the `printf` function in C. It gives you precise control over output formatting.

  * `printf "Format String" value1 value2 ...`
  * **Format Specifiers:**
      * `%s`: String
      * `%d`: Decimal integer
      * `%f`: Floating point number
      * `%.2f`: Floating point number with 2 decimal places
      * `\n`: Newline
      * `\t`: Tab
      * `%-10s`: Left-align a string in a 10-character field
      * `%5d`: Right-align a decimal integer in a 5-character field

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
printf "Name: %s, Age: %d\n" "Bob" 42
printf "The value of Pi is approximately %.4f\n" 3.14159265
printf "%-15s %10s\n" "Product" "Price" # Table-like output
printf "%-15s %10.2f\n" "Laptop" 1200.50
printf "%-15s %10.2f\n" "Mouse" 25.99
```

### `read`

Used to read input from the user (from **standard input - stdin**) or from a file.

  * `read VARIABLE_NAME`: Reads an entire line from stdin and stores it in `VARIABLE_NAME`.
  * `read -p "Prompt: " VARIABLE_NAME`: Displays a `Prompt:` before reading input.
  * `read -s VARIABLE_NAME`: **Silent mode**. Input is not echoed to the terminal, useful for passwords.
  * `read -t 5 VARIABLE_NAME`: Sets a **timeout** of 5 seconds. If no input is received within the timeout, the command exits.
  * `read -a ARRAY_NAME`: Reads words into an **indexed array**.

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter your name: " USER_NAME
echo "Hello, $USER_NAME!"

read -s -p "Enter your password: " PASS
echo # Add a newline after silent input, as -s doesn't add one
echo "Password received (but not displayed): $PASS"

echo "Waiting for input for 3 seconds..."
if read -t 3 USER_INPUT; then
    echo "You entered: $USER_INPUT"
else
    echo "No input received in time."
fi
```

### Redirection

Redirection allows you to change the default source of input or destination of output for commands.

| Symbol | Description | Example |
| :----- | :---------- | :------ |
| `>` | Redirects **standard output (stdout)** to a file. **Overwrites** the file if it exists. | `ls -l > file_list.txt` |
| `>>` | Redirects **stdout** to a file. **Appends** to the file if it exists. | `echo "new line" >> existing_file.txt` |
| `<` | Redirects **standard input (stdin)** from a file. | `sort < input.txt` |
| `2>` | Redirects **standard error (stderr)** to a file. **Overwrites** the file. | `command_that_might_fail 2> errors.log` |
| `2>>` | Redirects **stderr** to a file. **Appends** to the file. | `command_that_might_fail 2>> errors.log` |
| `&>` or `>` | Redirects **both stdout and stderr** to a file. **Overwrites** the file. (Using `>` is more common for this, but `&>` is more explicit and universally supported in Bash 4+). | `command_output_and_errors &> all_output.log` |
| `>>&` | Redirects **both stdout and stderr** to a file. **Appends** to the file. | `command_output_and_errors >>& all_output.log` |
| `1>&2` | Redirects **stdout (file descriptor 1)** to **stderr (file descriptor 2)**. Useful for making a regular message appear as an error. | `echo "This is an error message!" 1>&2` |
| `2>&1` | Redirects **stderr (file descriptor 2)** to **stdout (file descriptor 1)**. Commonly used with `>` or `>>` to capture both types of output in a single file. | `command_output_and_errors > all_output.log 2>&1` |
| `< <(cmd)` | **Process Substitution**. Allows the output of a command to be treated as a temporary file. | `diff <(ls dir1) <(ls dir2)` |
| `<< EOF` | **Here Document**. Provides multi-line input to a command. | `cat << END_MSG > my_message.txt`\<br\>`Hello,`\<br\>`This is a message.`\<br\>`END_MSG` |

**Example (Redirection):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Overwrite stdout to a file
echo "This is the first line." > output.txt
echo "This is the second line (overwrites first line)." > output.txt

# Append stdout to a file
echo "This line will be appended." >> output.txt
cat output.txt

# Redirect stderr to a file
ls /nonexistent_path 2> error.log
cat error.log

# Redirect both stdout and stderr to a single file
echo "Regular output." &> combined_output.log
ls /nonexistent_path >>& combined_output.log # Append to combined_output.log
cat combined_output.log

# Redirect stdout to stderr
echo "This will go to stderr" 1>&2
```

### Pipes (`|`)

The pipe operator connects the **standard output (stdout)** of one command to the **standard input (stdin)** of another command. This allows you to chain commands together, creating powerful data processing pipelines.

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# List files, then filter for lines containing "txt"
ls -l | grep "txt"

# Count the number of lines containing "error" in the system log
cat /var/log/syslog | grep "error" | wc -l

# Find all .sh files, then get their permissions, then display only unique permissions
find . -name "*.sh" -type f | xargs stat -c '%a %n' | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort -u
```

## 5\. Arithmetic Operations

Bash can perform integer arithmetic calculations.

  * **`$((expression))`**: This is the **preferred** and most versatile method for arithmetic expansion. It allows you to evaluate an arithmetic expression and use its result.
  * **`expr expression`**: An older command-line utility for evaluating expressions. It's less flexible and generally discouraged in modern Bash scripts for arithmetic.
  * **`let "expression"`**: Evaluates arithmetic expressions. It's concise but doesn't produce output directly to `stdout` like `$((...))`.

**Operators:**

  * `+`: Addition
  * `-`: Subtraction
  * `*`: Multiplication
  * `/`: Division
  * `%`: Modulo (remainder of division)
  * `**`: Exponentiation (power)
  * `++`: Increment (e.g., `((VAR++))`)
  * `--`: Decrement (e.g., `((VAR--))`)

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
NUM1=10
NUM2=3

# Using $((...)) for calculations
RESULT_SUM=$((NUM1 + NUM2))
echo "Sum: $NUM1 + $NUM2 = $RESULT_SUM"

RESULT_PRODUCT=$((NUM1 * NUM2))
echo "Product: $NUM1 * $NUM2 = $RESULT_PRODUCT"

RESULT_REMAINDER=$((NUM1 % NUM2))
echo "Remainder of $NUM1 / $NUM2 = $RESULT_REMAINDER"

RESULT_POWER=$((2**3))
echo "2 to the power of 3 = $RESULT_POWER"

# Increment/Decrement
COUNTER=1
((COUNTER++)) # Increment by 1
echo "Counter after increment: $COUNTER"
((COUNTER--)) # Decrement by 1
echo "Counter after decrement: $COUNTER"

# Using `let`
let "COMPLEX_CALC = (NUM1 * 2) - NUM2"
echo "Complex calculation: $COMPLEX_CALC"
```

**Note on Floating-Point Arithmetic:** Bash's built-in arithmetic is **only for integers**. For floating-point (decimal) calculations, you'll need to use external tools like `bc` (basic calculator) or `awk`.

**Example (Floating-Point with `bc`):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
FLOAT1=10.5
FLOAT2=2.3

# Use bc for floating-point arithmetic
RESULT_FLOAT=$(echo "$FLOAT1 + $FLOAT2" | bc -l) # -l loads math library for floats
echo "Float Sum: $RESULT_FLOAT"

RESULT_FLOAT_DIV=$(echo "scale=2; $FLOAT1 / $FLOAT2" | bc -l) # scale=2 sets precision
echo "Float Division (2 decimal places): $RESULT_FLOAT_DIV"
```

## 6\. Conditional Statements (`if`/`elif`/`else`)

Conditional statements allow your script to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.

  * `if condition; then ... fi`: Basic `if` statement.
  * `if condition; then ... else ... fi`: `if-else` statement for two branches.
  * `if condition1; then ... elif condition2; then ... else ... fi`: `if-elif-else` for multiple conditions.

**Conditions are tested using different syntaxes:**

  * **`[ condition ]`**: This is the **old-style** syntax, which is actually a shortcut for the `test` command. It's very portable but has some limitations (e.g., string comparisons are literal, no regex). Spaces are crucial around the brackets and operators.
  * **`[[ condition ]]`**: This is the **new Bash-specific** syntax, introduced in Bash 2.0. It's generally **preferred** for most string and file comparisons within Bash scripts because it's more powerful (e.g., regex matching, avoids word splitting issues).
  * **`(( expression ))`**: Used exclusively for **arithmetic comparisons**. It's very efficient and allows C-style expressions.

### Common Test Operators

### String Comparisons (`[[ ... ]]` or `[ ... ]`)

| Operator | Description | Example (`[[ ... ]]`) |
| :------- | :----------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| `==` | Equal to (regex matching in `[[`) | `[[ "$VAR" == "string" ]]` |
| `!=` | Not equal to | `[[ "$VAR" != "string" ]]` |
| `<` | Less than (lexicographical comparison based on ASCII values) | `[[ "$VAR" < "string" ]]` |
| `>` | Greater than (lexicographical comparison) | `[[ "$VAR" > "string" ]]` |
| `=~` | Regex match (`[[` only) | `[[ "$VAR" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]` (string contains only digits) |
| `-z` | String is empty (zero length) | `[[ -z "$VAR" ]]` |
| `-n` | String is not empty | `[[ -n "$VAR" ]]` |

**Important Note for `[ ... ]`:** When using `[ ... ]`, always double-quote your variables (e.g., `[ "$VAR" = "string" ]`) to prevent issues with empty or space-containing variables. The `[[ ... ]]` construct handles this better.

### Numeric Comparisons (`(( ... ))` or `[ ... ]`)

| Operator | Description | Example (`(( ... ))`) | Example (`[ ... ]`) |
| :------- | :--------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------ |
| `==` | Equal to | `(( A == B ))` | `[ "$A" -eq "$B" ]` |
| `!=` | Not equal to | `(( A != B ))` | `[ "$A" -ne "$B" ]` |
| `>` | Greater than | `(( A > B ))` | `[ "$A" -gt "$B" ]` |
| `<` | Less than | `(( A < B ))` | `[ "$A" -lt "$B" ]` |
| `>=` | Greater or equal | `(( A >= B ))` | `[ "$A" -ge "$B" ]` |
| `<=` | Less or equal | `(( A <= B ))` | `[ "$A" -le "$B" ]` |

### File Test Operators (`[ ... ]` or `[[ ... ]]`)

These operators check properties of files and directories.

| Operator | Description | Example |
| :------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| `-d` | File exists and is a **directory** | `[ -d "/path/to/dir" ]` |
| `-f` | File exists and is a **regular file** | `[ -f "/path/to/file.txt" ]` |
| `-e` | File **exists** (regular file, directory, symlink, etc.) | `[ -e "/path/to/anything" ]` |
| `-r` | File exists and is **readable** by the current user | `[ -r "/path/to/file.txt" ]` |
| `-w` | File exists and is **writable** by the current user | `[ -w "/path/to/file.txt" ]` |
| `-x` | File exists and is **executable** by the current user | `[ -x "/path/to/script.sh" ]` |
| `-s` | File exists and has a **size greater than zero** (not empty) | `[ -s "/path/to/file.txt" ]` |
| `-L` | File exists and is a **symbolic link** | `[ -L "/path/to/symlink" ]` |
| `file1 -nt file2` | `file1` is **newer than** `file2` | `[ "a.txt" -nt "b.txt" ]` |
| `file1 -ot file2` | `file1` is **older than** `file2` | `[ "a.txt" -ot "b.txt" ]` |

**Logical Operators (combining conditions):**

  * `&&`: **AND**. Both conditions must be true.
  * `||`: **OR**. At least one condition must be true.
  * `!`: **NOT**. Inverts the result of the condition.

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
AGE=25
NAME="Charlie"
FILE="/tmp/test_file.txt"

# Create a test file for demonstration
touch "$FILE"

if [[ $AGE -ge 18 && "$NAME" == "Charlie" ]]; then
    echo "$NAME is an adult."
fi

if (( AGE < 20 )); then
    echo "$NAME is young."
elif (( AGE >= 20 && AGE < 60 )); then
    echo "$NAME is middle-aged."
else
    echo "$NAME is a senior."
fi

if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then
    echo "$FILE exists and is a regular file."
else
    echo "$FILE does not exist or is not a regular file."
fi

# Demonstrate OR and NOT
if [[ -d "/nonexistent_dir" || ! -e "/tmp/another_nonexistent_file" ]]; then
    echo "Either /nonexistent_dir does not exist, or /tmp/another_nonexistent_file does not exist (or both)."
fi

rm "$FILE" # Clean up test file
```

## 7\. Case Statements (`case`)

A `case` statement provides a clean and efficient way to handle multiple conditional branches, especially when you're checking a single variable against various possible patterns. It's often cleaner than long chains of `if/elif/else`.

  * `case expression in pattern1) commands ;; pattern2) commands ;; esac`
  * **`expression`**: The value to test.
  * **`pattern`**: Can be literal strings, numbers, or wildcards (`*`, `?`, `[]`).
  * **`|`**: Use `|` to separate multiple patterns that should execute the same commands.
  * **`)`**: Marks the end of a pattern.
  * **`;;`**: Terminates the commands for a pattern. It's crucial for the `case` to work correctly.
  * **`*)`**: The default case (like `default` in `switch` statements), which matches anything not matched by previous patterns.

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter a fruit (apple, banana, orange, or other): " FRUIT

case "$FRUIT" in
    apple|banana) # Matches either "apple" or "banana"
        echo "It's a common fruit."
        ;;
    orange) # Matches "orange"
        echo "It's a citrus fruit."

## 8\. Loops

Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times, either for a fixed number of iterations, while a condition is true, or until a condition becomes true.

### `for` Loop

The `for` loop is used to iterate over a list of items or perform actions a specific number of times.

  * **Iterating over a list/words:**
    `for VAR in item1 item2 "item three" ...; do commands; done`
      * Iterates through each `item` in the provided list.
      * **Best Practice:** Always double-quote `"$VAR"` when using it inside the loop to prevent issues with spaces or special characters in the items.
  * **C-style (arithmetic progression):**
    `for (( INITIALIZER; CONDITION; INCREMENT )); do commands; done`
      * Similar to `for` loops in C, C++, or Java.
      * Useful for iterating a specific number of times or through numerical ranges.
  * **Iterating over files/glob patterns:**
    `for FILE in *; do commands; done`
      * The wildcard `*` expands to all files and directories in the current location. Be cautious with filenames containing spaces.

**Loop Control Statements:**

  * `break`: Exits the current loop immediately.
  * `continue`: Skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Iterate over a list of strings
echo "--- Iterating over a list ---"
for FRUIT in "Apple Pie" Banana Cherry; do
    echo "I like $FRUIT."
done

# C-style loop for a specific number of iterations
echo "--- C-style loop ---"
for (( i=1; i<=5; i++ )); do
    echo "Count: $i"
done

# Iterate over files in the current directory
echo "--- Iterating over files ---"
touch file1.txt file2.log script.sh # Create some dummy files
for FILE in *; do # * expands to all files/directories
    if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then # Check if it's a regular file
        echo "Processing file: $FILE"
    fi
done
rm file1.txt file2.log script.sh # Clean up

# Loop with break and continue
echo "--- Loop with break/continue ---"
for i in {1..10}; do
    if (( i % 2 != 0 )); then # If odd, skip to next iteration
        continue
    fi
    echo "Even number: $i"
    if (( i >= 6 )); then # If 6 or more, stop the loop
        break
    fi
done
```

### `while` Loop

The `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of commands **as long as its condition remains true**.

  * `while condition; do commands; done`
  * The `condition` can be any test (e.g., `[ ... ]`, `[[ ... ]]`, `(( ... ))`) or a command. The loop continues as long as the condition/command returns an exit status of `0` (success).

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
COUNT=0
echo "--- While loop (simple counter) ---"
while (( COUNT < 3 )); do
    echo "Count is: $COUNT"
    ((COUNT++)) # Increment COUNT
done

# Read line by line from a file
echo "--- While loop (reading file line by line) ---"
echo "Line A" > input.txt
echo "Line B" >> input.txt
echo "Line C" >> input.txt

while IFS= read -r LINE; do # IFS= prevents leading/trailing whitespace trimming, -r prevents backslash interpretation
    echo "Reading line: $LINE"
done < input.txt # Redirect input.txt to the while loop's stdin

rm input.txt # Clean up

# Wait for a file to exist
echo "--- While loop (wait for file) ---"
FILE_TO_WAIT="/tmp/my_temp_file.lock"
echo "Waiting for $FILE_TO_WAIT to appear..."
while [ ! -f "$FILE_TO_WAIT" ]; do # Loop as long as file does NOT exist
    echo -n "."
    sleep 1 # Wait for 1 second
done
echo -e "\n$FILE_TO_WAIT found! Continuing script."
rm "$FILE_TO_WAIT" # Clean up
```

### `until` Loop

The `until` loop repeatedly executes a block of commands **as long as its condition remains false**. It's the inverse of the `while` loop.

  * `until condition; do commands; done`
  * The loop continues as long as the `condition` (or command) returns a non-zero exit status (failure). It stops when the condition becomes true (exit status `0`).

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
COUNT=5
echo "--- Until loop (countdown) ---"
until (( COUNT == 0 )); do # Loop until COUNT is 0
    echo "Countdown: $COUNT"
    ((COUNT--))
done
echo "Blast off!"
```

### `select` Loop (Menu Creation)

The `select` loop is specifically designed to create simple, interactive numbered menus in a Bash script. It presents a list of options to the user and waits for them to choose one.

  * `select VAR in item1 item2 ...; do commands; done`
  * **`PS3`**: This special variable sets the prompt that the `select` loop displays to the user.
  * The chosen item (or `REPLY` if the input is not a numbered option) is stored in the `VAR` variable.
  * Typically, a `case` statement is used inside a `select` loop to handle the user's choice.
  * Use `break` to exit the `select` loop once a valid choice is made.

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "--- Select loop (interactive menu) ---"
PS3="Choose an action: " # Set the prompt for the select menu
select CHOICE in "List files" "Show disk space" "Show uptime" "Exit"; do
    case "$CHOICE" in
        "List files")
            ls -l
            ;;
        "Show disk space")
            df -h
            ;;
        "Show uptime")
            uptime
            ;;
        "Exit")
            echo "Exiting the script. Goodbye!"
            break # Exit the select loop
            ;;
        *) # Default case for invalid input
            echo "Invalid choice: '$REPLY'. Please enter a number from the menu."
            ;;
    esac
    echo # Add a newline for better readability after each action
done
```

## 9\. Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help organize your script, improve readability, and prevent code duplication.

  * **Declaration:**
      * `function_name() { commands; }` (Modern and preferred syntax)
      * `function function_name { commands; }` (Older, but still valid syntax)
  * **Calling:** To execute a function, just type its name: `function_name arg1 arg2`.
  * **Arguments:** Arguments passed to a function are accessed using the same special variables as script arguments: `$1`, `$2`, `$@`, `$#`, etc.
  * **Return Status:**
      * `return N`: Exits the function and sets its exit status (accessible via `$?`) to `N`. `0` for success, non-zero for error.
      * If `return` is not explicitly used, the function's exit status is the exit status of the **last command** executed within the function.
  * **Local Variables:** Always use `local var_name="value"` inside functions to declare variables. This prevents them from interfering with global variables of the same name and makes your functions self-contained.

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function with arguments and return status
greet_user() {
    local name="$1" # Store first argument in a local variable
    local greeting_message="Hello"

    if [ -z "$name" ]; then # Check if name is empty
        echo "ERROR: No name provided to greet_user function." 1>&2 # Output error to stderr
        return 1 # Indicate an error
    fi

    # Using local variable
    echo "${greeting_message}, $name!"
    return 0 # Indicate success
}

# Function to calculate sum
calculate_sum() {
    local num1=$1
    local num2=$2
    local sum=$((num1 + num2))
    echo "$sum" # Output the result to stdout
}

# --- Calling functions ---

echo "--- Calling greet_user ---"
greet_user "Alice" # Call with an argument
echo "greet_user exit status: $?"

greet_user # Call without an argument (will error)
echo "greet_user exit status: $?"

echo "--- Calling calculate_sum ---"
# Capture the output of calculate_sum into a variable using command substitution
TOTAL=$(calculate_sum 15 20)
echo "The sum is: $TOTAL"

# Demonstrate function that calls another function
parent_function() {
    echo "Inside parent_function."
    local child_result=$(greet_user "Child") # Call a child function
    local child_status=$? # Check child function's status
    echo "Child function output: '$child_result'"
    echo "Child function status: $child_status"
}

echo "--- Calling parent_function ---"
parent_function
```

## 10\. Command Substitution

Command substitution allows you to use the **output of a command** as part of another command or to assign it to a variable.

  * **`$(command)`**: This is the **preferred and modern syntax**. It's easier to read and allows for nesting command substitutions without complex escaping.
  * **`` `command` ``**: This is the **older backtick syntax**. It's still functional but can be harder to read, especially when nesting, as backticks require escaping (`\` `command` \`\`\`).

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Get the current date using command substitution
CURRENT_DATE=$(date "+%Y-%m-%d")
echo "Today's date is: $CURRENT_DATE"

# Count the number of files in the current directory using command substitution
# `ls -l` output includes a total line, so we subtract 1 from `wc -l`
FILE_COUNT=$(ls -l | wc -l)
echo "Total files/directories (excluding 'total' line): $((FILE_COUNT - 1))"

# Using older backtick syntax (less recommended)
KERNEL_VERSION=`uname -r`
echo "Kernel version (using backticks): $KERNEL_VERSION"

# Nested command substitution (shows why `$(...)` is better)
# Get the current user's home directory from the output of `whoami`
USER_HOME=$(echo ~$(whoami))
echo "Current user's home directory: $USER_HOME"
```

## 11\. Arrays

Arrays allow you to store multiple values in a single variable. Bash supports two types of arrays: indexed (numerical indices) and associative (string keys).

### Indexed Arrays

These are arrays where elements are accessed using numerical indices, starting from `0`.

  * **Declaration & Assignment:**
      * `ARRAY_NAME=(item1 item2 "item three" item4)`
      * You can assign individual elements: `ARRAY_NAME[0]="First"` `ARRAY_NAME[1]="Second"`
  * **Accessing Elements:** `${ARRAY_NAME[index]}`
      * Example: `${MY_ARRAY[0]}` accesses the first element.
  * **All Elements:**
      * `${ARRAY_NAME[@]}`: Expands to all elements, each as a separate word. This is generally preferred for loops or when passing elements as arguments.
      * `${ARRAY_NAME[*]}`: Expands to all elements as a single word (like `"$*"`).
  * **Number of Elements (Length):** `${#ARRAY_NAME[@]}`
  * **Adding Elements:**
      * `ARRAY_NAME+=(new_item)`: Appends new elements to the end.
      * `ARRAY_NAME[new_index]="new_item"`: Assigns an element at a specific index.
  * **Removing Elements:** `unset ARRAY_NAME[index]`
      * Removes a specific element. The index becomes empty.
  * **Removing Entire Array:** `unset ARRAY_NAME`

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "--- Indexed Arrays ---"
FRUITS=("Apple" "Banana" "Cherry" "Durian")

echo "First fruit: ${FRUITS[0]}"
echo "Third fruit: ${FRUITS[2]}"
echo "All fruits: ${FRUITS[@]}"
echo "Number of fruits: ${#FRUITS[@]}"

FRUITS+=( "Elderberry" "Fig" ) # Add elements to the end
echo "After adding: ${FRUITS[@]}"

FRUITS[1]="Blueberry" # Modify element at index 1
echo "After modifying index 1: ${FRUITS[@]}"

unset FRUITS[3] # Remove 'Durian' (index 3)
echo "After removing index 3: ${FRUITS[@]}"
echo "Number of fruits now: ${#FRUITS[@]}" # Length will reflect removal

echo "Looping through fruits (using \"@\"): "
for fruit in "${FRUITS[@]}"; do
    echo "- $fruit"
done
```

### Associative Arrays (Hash Maps/Dictionaries)

Requires **Bash 4.0 or newer**. These arrays store key-value pairs, where keys are strings (like in Python dictionaries or JavaScript objects).

  * **Declaration:** `declare -A ARRAY_NAME` (The `-A` is crucial\!)
  * **Assigning Values:** `ARRAY_NAME[key]="value"`
  * **Accessing Values:** `${ARRAY_NAME[key]}`
  * **All Keys:** `${!ARRAY_NAME[@]}` (Note the `!` before the array name)
  * **All Values:** `${ARRAY_NAME[@]}` (This will give you values, but without their corresponding keys)
  * **Number of Elements (Length):** `${#ARRAY_NAME[@]}`

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "--- Associative Arrays ---"
declare -A CAPITAL_CITIES

CAPITAL_CITIES["Germany"]="Berlin"
CAPITAL_CITIES["France"]="Paris"
CAPITAL_CITIES["Spain"]="Madrid"
CAPITAL_CITIES["Japan"]="Tokyo"

echo "Capital of Germany: ${CAPITAL_CITIES["Germany"]}"
echo "Capital of Japan: ${CAPITAL_CITIES["Japan"]}"

echo "All capital cities (iterating through keys):"
for country in "${!CAPITAL_CITIES[@]}"; do
    echo "$country: ${CAPITAL_CITIES[$country]}"
done

echo "Number of countries: ${#CAPITAL_CITIES[@]}"

# Add a new entry
CAPITAL_CITIES["Italy"]="Rome"
echo "After adding Italy: ${CAPITAL_CITIES["Italy"]}"

# Remove an entry
unset CAPITAL_CITIES["Spain"]
echo "After removing Spain, all countries are:"
for country in "${!CAPITAL_CITIES[@]}"; do
    echo "- $country"
done
```

## 12\. Debugging Bash Scripts

Debugging is an essential skill for writing robust and error-free Bash scripts. Bash provides several built-in mechanisms to help you troubleshoot.

  * **`set -x` (Trace Mode):**
      * Prints each command and its arguments after they have been expanded, just before execution. This gives you a step-by-step trace of your script.
      * **Usage:** Place `set -x` at the beginning of your script, or before the specific section you want to debug.
      * **Turn off:** Use `set +x` to disable tracing.
  * **`set -e` (Exit on Error):**
      * If any command in the script (excluding `if`, `while`, `until` conditions, and commands in `&&` or `||` lists) returns a non-zero exit status (i.e., fails), the script will immediately exit.
      * This prevents silent failures and unexpected behavior that can occur when a command fails but the script continues anyway.
  * **`set -u` (Unset Variables Error):**
      * If you attempt to use a variable that hasn't been set (e.g., due to a typo), the script will exit with an error.
      * This is extremely helpful for catching common typing mistakes.
  * **`set -o pipefail` (Pipeline Failure):**
      * If any command in a pipeline (`cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3`) fails (returns a non-zero exit status), the entire pipeline's exit status will be that of the failing command.
      * Without `pipefail`, a pipeline's exit status is determined only by the *last* command in the pipeline, which can mask errors in earlier commands.
  * **`bash -n script.sh` (No-Execute/Syntax Check):**
      * Checks the script for syntax errors without actually executing any commands. Useful for quick syntax validation.
  * **`bash -v script.sh` (Verbose Mode):**
      * Prints shell input lines as they are read, before execution. This shows you exactly what Bash is reading from your script file.
  * **`echo` statements:**
      * Simple but effective. Insert `echo` statements to print the values of variables at different points in your script to see how they change.
  * **Logging:**
      * As shown in the initial sections, comprehensive logging (to a file and/or stderr) helps you track the script's flow and pinpoint where issues occur, especially in long-running or background processes.

**Common Robust Script Header (often at the top of a production script):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail # Combines -e, -u, and -o pipefail

# Add -x for debugging specific sections:
# set -x
# problematic_command_here
# set +x

# ... rest of your script ...
```

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# set -euo pipefail # Uncomment this line to see -e, -u, -o pipefail in action

log_error() {
    echo "ERROR: $1" >&2
}

echo "Starting script..."

# Demonstrating set -x
set -x # Turn on tracing
MY_VARIABLE="some value"
echo "My variable is: $MY_VARIABLE"
set +x # Turn off tracing

echo "After tracing section."

# Demonstrating set -e (if uncommented above)
# This command will fail, and if set -e is active, the script will exit here
# ls /this_directory_does_not_exist_12345

echo "This line will only be reached if the previous 'ls' command succeeded (or if set -e is off)."

# Demonstrating set -u (if uncommented above)
# Attempting to use an unset variable will cause an error
# echo "Value of UNSET_VAR: $UNSET_VAR"

echo "Script finished."
```

      * `-l`: Long listing format (permissions, owner, size, date).
      * `-a`: All entries, including hidden files (starting with `.`).
      * `-h`: Human-readable sizes (e.g., 1K, 234M, 2G).
      * `-d`: List directory entries themselves, not their contents.
      * `-t`: Sort by modification time, newest first.
      * `-r`: Reverse order while sorting.
  * `cd [directory]`: **Change directory**.

      * `-p`: Create parent directories if they don't exist (e.g., `mkdir -p a/b/c`).
      * `-m mode`: Set file permissions directly (e.g., `mkdir -m 700 mydir`).
  * `rm [options] file...`: **Remove files or directories**. Use with extreme caution, especially `rm -rf`.
      * `-r`: Recursive (for directories and their contents).
      * `-f`: Force (ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt).
      * `-i`: Prompt before every removal.
  * `cp [options] source destination`: **Copy files/directories**.
      * `-r`: Recursive (for directories).
      * `-p`: Preserve attributes (permissions, ownership, timestamps).

## 14\. Best Practices & Tips

Writing good Bash scripts goes beyond just knowing the commands. Adhering to best practices makes your scripts more readable, maintainable, and robust.

1.  **Always use a Shebang:** Start every script with `#!/bin/bash` or `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
2.  **Use `set -euo pipefail`:**
      * `set -e`: Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
      * `set -u`: Treat unset variables as an error and exit.
      * `set -o pipefail`: Return the exit status of the rightmost command that exited with a non-zero status in a pipeline.
      * These three lines combined are a cornerstone of robust Bash scripting.
3.  **Double-Quote Variables:** Always double-quote variable expansions (`"$VAR"`, `"${ARRAY[@]}"`) unless you explicitly need word splitting or pathname expansion. This prevents unexpected behavior with spaces, newlines, or glob characters.
4.  **Use `local` for Function Variables:** Declare variables within functions using `local` to prevent unintended side effects and global namespace pollution.
5.  **Meaningful Variable and Function Names:** Use descriptive names (e.g., `USER_COUNT`, `process_logs`) instead of generic ones (e.g., `x`, `p`).
6.  **Add Comments Generously:** Explain complex logic, obscure commands, or any non-obvious parts of your script.
7.  **Handle Arguments Gracefully:** Use positional parameters (`$1`, `$2`, `$@`) and consider using `getopts` for more complex option parsing (like `script.sh -f input.txt -v`).
8.  **Validate Input:** If your script takes user input or arguments, validate them (e.g., check if a file exists, if a number is in range).
9.  **Provide User Feedback:** Use `echo` or `printf` to inform the user what the script is doing, especially for long-running tasks. Use `stderr` for error messages.
10. **Implement Error Handling:** Use `if` statements to check the exit status of commands (`if ! command; then log_error "Failed"; exit 1; fi`).
11. **Use Functions for Modularity:** Break down your script into smaller, reusable functions.
12. **Avoid Parsing `ls` Output:** `ls` output is for human consumption. For scripting, use `find` or globbing directly.
13. **Prefer `[[ ... ]]` over `[ ... ]`:** For conditionals, `[[ ... ]]` is more robust and allows for more features (like regex matching).
14. **Avoid Uppercase for User-Defined Variables:** While common, it can conflict with system-defined environment variables. Some prefer lowercase or mixed-case for user-defined variables to avoid this, reserving uppercase for environment variables.
15. **Use `trap` for Cleanup:** Use `trap "commands" EXIT` to ensure certain commands (like cleaning up temporary files) run even if the script exits unexpectedly.
16. **Test Incrementally:** Write small pieces of code, test them, and then combine them.
17. **Version Control:** Store your scripts in a version control system (like Git) to track changes and collaborate.

**Example (Robust Script Template):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# A robust Bash script template

# --- Configuration ---
LOG_FILE="/var/log/my_script.log"
APP_NAME="MyScript"
REQUIRED_TOOL="curl" # Example of a required tool

# --- ANSI Color Codes (for pretty output) ---
GREEN='\e[32m'
RED='\e[31m'
YELLOW='\e[33m'
RESET='\e[0m'

# --- Logging Functions ---
log_message() {
    echo -e "${GREEN}[INFO]$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - $1${RESET}" | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"
}

log_warning() {
    echo -e "${YELLOW}[WARN]$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - $1${RESET}" | tee -a "$LOG_FILE" >&2
}

log_error() {
    echo -e "${RED}[ERROR]$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - $1${RESET}" | tee -a "$LOG_FILE" >&2
}

# --- Trap for cleanup (runs on script exit) ---
cleanup() {
    local exit_code=$? # Get the exit status of the script
    log_message "Script finished with exit code: $exit_code."
    # Add any cleanup commands here (e.g., rm -rf /tmp/my_temp_dir)
}
trap cleanup EXIT # Register the cleanup function to run on script exit

# --- Script Configuration / Error Handling ---
set -euo pipefail # Exit on error, unset variables, pipeline failure

# --- Check for Root Privileges ---
check_root() {
    if [[ $EUID -ne 0 ]]; then
        log_error "This script must be run as root."
        echo "Please run: sudo $0"
        exit 1 # Exit with error
    fi
    log_message "Running as root."
}

# --- Check for Required Tools ---
check_dependencies() {
    if ! command -v "$REQUIRED_TOOL" &> /dev/null; then
        log_error "$REQUIRED_TOOL is not installed. Please install it to proceed."
        exit 1
    fi
    log_message "$REQUIRED_TOOL is installed."
}

# --- Main Logic ---
main() {
    check_root
    check_dependencies

    log_message "Starting $APP_NAME operations..."

    local user_name=""
    read -p "Enter a username: " user_name
    if [ -z "$user_name" ]; then
        log_error "Username cannot be empty. Exiting."
        exit 1
    fi

    log_message "Processing user: $user_name"
    # Example: Perform some operation
    echo "Simulating some work for $user_name..."
    sleep 2

    # Simulate success or failure
    if (( RANDOM % 2 == 0 )); then # 50% chance of success
        log_message "Operation for $user_name completed successfully."
    else
        log_error "Operation for $user_name failed unexpectedly."
        exit 1 # Indicate an error that triggers trap
    fi
}

# --- Execute Main Function ---
main "$@" # Pass all script arguments to the main function
```
